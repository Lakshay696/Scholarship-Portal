<br><u  style="color:#fff " style="font-weight: bold ">A. Do Research work</br></u>
</p>
 <p> A short Google search on your (hopefully) new friend should yield useful information. It can also assist you in coming up with pointed questions to ask them. Have they participated in well-known initiatives or worked for a company you are interested in? Asking them about their particular experience will demonstrate your concern.</p>

  <br><u style="color:#fff">B. Create Persona Maps for each alumni group</br></u>
</p>
<p> Once you've gathered crucial information about your connections, you'll be able to segment them to better speak their language. 
    <li style="color: white">Are they more likely to connect through Twitter or LinkedIn?</li>
    <li style="color: white">What kind of jobs do they have now?</li>
        
</p>

  <br><u  style="color:#fff">C.Build Connections</br></u>
</p>
<p> When you send that cold email, don't hold back from establishing your shared alumni status. Use the knowledge you gained in step one! Mention any clear common experiences you two have (chess club, anyone?). People are drawn to others who they can directly relate to. Don't withhold important information that could assist you establish rapport!</p>

  <br><u  style="color:#fff">D. Use LinkedIn to Promote Networking & Learning Among Alumni</br></u>
</p>
<p> LinkedIn is a professional social network designed to bring people together in the working world. LinkedIn is a major platform to utilize to show you still care about their progress.</p>

  <br><u  style="color:#fff">E. Establish parameters of the conversation</br></u>
</p>
<p> Be very specific about what you want—a 15-minute phone call? a quick email conversation? A gathering near their workplace for 30 minutes? You demonstrate respect for their hectic schedule by making sure your request is concise and time-bound.

    You may show how much you value their knowledge and effort by making your request plain and simple. After all, no one wants to enrol in a digressive, aimless career counselling session.
    </p>

  <br><u  style="color:#fff">F. Thank them for their time</br></u>
</p>
<p>Don't offer a former student who graduated many years ago an excuse to say, "Kids these days," when you contact them. Make sure to express gratitude for their consideration in advance. After all, they are devoting time to reading your email throughout their busy day! Even if they are unable to assist you, you have already made a request of them. You'll increase your chance of receiving a "Yes, sure!" by expressing your thankfulness up front. </p>
